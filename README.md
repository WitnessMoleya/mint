## weather Application
The app that we have been given to create is an app that shows the weather condition daily like on weekly days.
it must show temperatures and basically other days temp.
based on the one i did is a weather app where you research or search the day you want to see its temp and condition and it will appear as you did searched 

### activities
in this app of mine you will find that it have too many activities 
those activities are perfectly made for a reason basically on the challenge that i actually met on the app building process
we do have a cover page where it also welcome you , second page where you have to search for the day you want and it also have three buttons(Back,Exit,& Check)
those other activities are days activities where you will get your results

#### Code

all code are running smoothly in those activity no errors based on all activities
longest code is located at the second activity (MainActivity2) where by there's a searching process for everything

##### APP
the app is running smoothly no errors
all constrains are perfect
all buttons are working
codes are working
perfect backgrounds
